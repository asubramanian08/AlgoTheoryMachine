## PrincetonAlgoTheoryMachine

### About
I took Coursera's [Computer Science: Algorithms, Theory, and Machines](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-algorithms-theory-machines) by Princeton over the summer of 2021. The instructors, Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne, teach a wide range of CS topics from sorting to turing machines to CPUs. The course is broken down into lectures 11-20 from the _Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach_ textbook. The other half of the textbook was made into the coursera course [Computer Science: Programming with a Purpose](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-programming-java). Their [booksite](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/) contains resources and bits of information from the textbook. Although the course is free to enroll on coursera, there is no certificate given after its completion.

### Organization
Each week or lecture is broken down into the lecture(not for public use), pages in the book and useful material links (_Supplements_), my notes, enrichment questions and my answers(private), and the graded quiz questions and answers(private). Each week has an optional some optional programming assignments selected from the book and a graded quiz on the material of the week.
